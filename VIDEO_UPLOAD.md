OpenPatch — The Public Feature Layer for the Web | OpenAI Build Week 2026

## YouTube description

OpenPatch lets people add safe, reusable features to websites they do not control.

One person describes a missing capability to GPT-5.6 through Codex. The OpenPatch authoring skill inspects the live DOM and screenshots, maps the need to a constrained transformation DSL, validates policy and scope, and runs browser tests. The resulting community patch is deterministic and domain-scoped. Everyone else installs it without AI, an account, or an API key.

The flagship MetroCare patch adds private search, combined access filters, and keyboard-accessible provider comparison to a realistic healthcare directory. The Compatibility Sentinel verifies exact patch bytes and live selectors every six hours, quarantining repairs when the original website changes underneath them.

Current release evidence: 44 unit/policy tests + 20 desktop/mobile browser journeys + 6 packaged-extension integrations pass (70 total). Eight additional post-deploy axe scans across four production surfaces report zero automated WCAG A/AA violations.

Built with GPT-5.6 and Codex for OpenAI Build Week 2026. The healthcare directory and providers are fictional demonstration data; this is not medical guidance.
