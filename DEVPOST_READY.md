## Step 3 — Project details

### Project story

Paste the Markdown below into **Project story**.

## Inspiration

People are forced to use websites they did not choose and cannot change: government forms, university portals, healthcare directories, marketplaces, and legacy work tools. Those sites do not need to be visibly broken to fail someone. A directory can work exactly as designed and still omit the filter an access need requires. The usual answer is “wait for the owner.” OpenPatch gives users another answer.

## What it does

OpenPatch is a public feature layer for the web: a Manifest V3 browser extension, a constrained transformation language, a Codex patch-authoring skill and plugin, and a machine-readable community registry.

One person describes a missing capability to GPT-5.6 through Codex. The OpenPatch authoring workflow inspects the DOM and screenshots, turns the complaint into observable acceptance criteria, chooses safe built-in operations, validates every selector and permission, and runs behavior tests. The published patch is declarative data scoped to exact hosts and paths. It cannot contain arbitrary JavaScript, HTML, callbacks, fetches, cookies, templates, or page-text extraction.

Everyone downstream gets the repair without AI, an account, or an API key. The extension discovers a matching registry patch, validates the DSL and scope again, verifies its SHA-256 receipt, checks the current DOM, requests only the declared Chrome domains, and installs it locally.

Our flagship MetroCare demo starts as a credible twelve-provider healthcare directory with useful data but no search, no combined access filters, and no comparison. An eleven-operation community patch adds private search, type/access/language/availability filters, local preferences, keyboard shortcuts, ARIA announcements, and a keyboard-accessible provider comparison table. Wheelchair access + Urdu + accepting new patients reduces twelve services to one understandable choice. Filtering and comparison emit zero network requests.

CivicApply is a second independently verified patch. Its nineteen constrained operations repair a fixed-width application form, preserve unfinished non-sensitive progress locally, add specific accessible validation and keyboard navigation, move human help into the workflow, and remove an obstructive survey.

## How we built it

- TypeScript safe-transformation DSL with nine bounded capabilities
- Manifest V3 extension with automatic registry discovery, manual import, exact-domain permissions, SHA-256 verification, and live selector preflight
- Trusted collection filter and comparison builders that read only declared `data-*` attributes
- Repository-discovered `.agents/skills/openpatch-author` workflow plus an installable Codex plugin
- Vite public product, two realistic demo targets, and machine-readable registry artifacts
- Playwright, Vitest, JSDOM, and axe accessibility tests
- GitHub Actions clean-install CI and a six-hour Compatibility Sentinel
- Vercel production deployment with no login or test account required

GPT-5.6 and Codex were used at the high-judgment engineering boundary: converting the product idea into architecture, authoring and threat-modeling the DSL, iterating from browser evidence, building the extension and registry, writing the two patches, creating the reusable authoring skill, and producing the tests and release evidence. Human decisions set the product direction: a public repair layer rather than a theme editor, deterministic distribution without model calls, and a deliberately constrained DSL instead of a userscript marketplace.

## Challenges

The hardest problem was making repairs powerful enough to add real missing product features without turning the registry into arbitrary-code distribution. `collectionFilter` and `collectionCompare` therefore accept no HTML, JavaScript, callbacks, templates, or URLs. Trusted runtime code creates native controls from one exact collection and explicitly declared data attributes, with bounded item, field, and selection counts.

Website drift was the second hard problem. A valid patch can become unsafe when the original site changes. The Compatibility Sentinel opens every published target in Chromium every six hours, binds the live structural fingerprint to the exact patch SHA, and quarantines drifted or unreachable entries before the extension recommends them.

Accessibility testing also exposed a subtle regression: entrance-animation opacity reduced otherwise acceptable contrast before sections were scrolled into view. Strict axe scans caught it. We fixed the source color system and made the scrollable comparison region labeled and keyboard-focusable instead of suppressing the audit.

## Accomplishments

- A complete author-once, install-many community repair loop
- 11/11 MetroCare operations and 10/10 publication assertions healthy
- 19/19 CivicApply operations and 10/10 publication assertions healthy
- 44 unit, policy, registry, compatibility, preflight, runtime, and privacy tests passing
- 20 desktop/mobile browser journeys passing, including six strict WCAG A/AA scans
- 6 packaged Manifest V3 integration tests passing across install, production, removal, and the domain switch
- 70 checks in the full release gate
- Eight additional post-deploy axe scans across four production surfaces at mobile and desktop widths with zero automated violations
- A six-hour live monitor with transient retries, retained receipts, and automatic quarantine/recovery promotion
- A public MIT-licensed repository, stable no-login demo, extension archive, and Codex plugin archive

## What we learned

The safest repair is the smallest constrained operation that makes an acceptance criterion observable. Selector health is not merely test output; it is a product feature that tells a community when the original site changed. AI belongs at the ambiguous authoring boundary, while distribution should be deterministic, reviewable, private, and cheap for everyone downstream.

## What's next

Publisher signing, moderation, community review, reputation and rollback controls, more repair primitives such as task-focused reading modes and guided multi-step workflows, and real-world pilots with civic, education, and accessibility communities.

## Test it now

Open the live MetroCare directory and choose **Preview OpenPatch instantly**. No build, login, credential, API key, or extension is required. For the full distribution path, the README includes a prebuilt Chrome extension, exact installation steps, supported platforms, and integrity hashes.

### Is this project new?

```text
Yes. OpenPatch was created during the Build Week submission period. The first public commit is dated July 19, 2026, and BUILD_WEEK.md maps each milestone, human decision, GPT-5.6/Codex contribution, and executable proof.
```

### How Codex and GPT-5.6 were used / how the project improved

```text
GPT-5.6 through Codex was the primary engineering collaborator throughout this new project. It translated the public repair-layer concept into a Manifest V3 extension, constrained DSL, public registry, compatibility monitor, and installable authoring skill; authored and threat-modeled the runtime; inspected browser evidence; created behavior, privacy, extension, and accessibility tests; and iterated on failures until the complete release gate passed. Human judgment chose the product direction, rejected an early form-only proof as too small, selected a credible healthcare missing-feature demo, required deterministic no-API-key distribution, and constrained community patches instead of accepting arbitrary userscripts. The dated commit trail and BUILD_WEEK.md distinguish decisions, iterations, and evidence.
```

### Codex `/feedback` Session ID

```text
CODEX_FEEDBACK_SESSION_ID
```

Obtain this from the primary build thread immediately before final submission.

### Judge testing instructions

```text
No account, credential, API key, or rebuild is required.

1. Open https://openpatch-tau.vercel.app/care/ and observe twelve service cards with no search, filters, or comparison.
2. Choose “Preview OpenPatch instantly.” The same constrained runtime used by the extension applies and reports 11/11 healthy operations.
3. Select Harbor Family Clinic and Northside Community Health, then choose “Compare selected” to open the keyboard-accessible private decision table.
4. Close and clear the comparison. Choose Wheelchair access, Urdu, and Accepting new patients. Observe “1 of 12 services match” and Harbor Family Clinic.
5. Reload to confirm the preferences stay on-device; press / to focus search.
6. Optional full distribution test: download the prebuilt extension from https://openpatch-tau.vercel.app/downloads/openpatch-extension-v0.8.0.zip, unzip it, open chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode, choose Load unpacked, and select the unzipped folder. Reopen MetroCare: the extension discovers the matching verified registry patch, checks its receipt and 11/11 current targets, and installs it on the exact domain. The installed patch can then be disabled or removed from the same popup.
7. Open https://openpatch-tau.vercel.app/sentinel/ to inspect live compatibility evidence and simulate quarantine.

Supported platform: Chrome/Chromium 120+ on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The live demos work in any modern browser.
